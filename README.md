Practiced:
● Insert new user data
● Update existing records
● Delete specific rows
● Write SELECT queries with conditions, sorting, and limits

Challenging part about this practice was figuring out Code 1175. It blocks UPDATE or DELETE queries unless I used a key column (like id) in my WHERE clause.
